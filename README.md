# ASSIGNMENT

Please estimate the duration in calendar days and let me know how long it would take to complete. I will schedule a meeting for the day after the estimated completion for us to walk together through the assignment. If you have any questions you may ask and I try to answer within a day or max two. Let me know also which desktop host, Android target and Android OS version you will be using, you may pick the one you prefer or find the most handy.

Background information

-Open source license

-Qt 5.15 (latest that you can get, likely 5.15.3) or Qt 6.5

-Qt Creator 10.0.0 (or later, if available)

-Desktop host, Android target device

Create

-App gets weather info from Oulu, Finland area stations from Ilmatieteenlaitos open data API's and shows where is:

a) highest temp in C

b) strongest wind in m/s

c) lowest airpressure in hPA

-Info updates via signal-slot / properties mechanism from C++ code to UI implemented in QML

-If you have personal ambitions feel free to implement some QML-candy, map or other fancy stuff or just keep it simple and create solid C++ instead - or both ðŸ™‚

Run app on desktop and on Android mobile device - check that is scales and feels responsive
